# Kanban Task  Organizer App

## Description
This is a web application which allows the user to keep track of their tasks/to-dos by tracking their due dates and statuses via a visual and interactive Kanban board. The user will enter a task with a description and due date and then is able to drag and drop that item to different sections indicating progress on that task.
## Installation

## Usage
The user must enter in task information via a modal menu. This information will be used to create a new task card for each task the user enters in. They can click on each task card and will be able to drage it to different sections of the page to indicate whether the task has been started or completed. The task card should appear red if the due date has passed and yellow if it is due on that day. Each task card will also have a delete button to remove it from the user's tasks if desired.
